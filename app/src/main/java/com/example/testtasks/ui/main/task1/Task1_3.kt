/*
Every valid email consists of a local and domain name, separated by the '@' sign.
Besides lowercase letters, the local name may contain one or more '.' or '+'.

If there is '.' in the local name part,
mail will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name
(example: "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address)

If there is '+' in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored.
(example: "m.y+name@email.com" will be forwarded to "my@email.com")

Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.

How many different addresses actually receive mails?
